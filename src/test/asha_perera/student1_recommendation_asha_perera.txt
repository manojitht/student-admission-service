RECOMMENDATION LETTER
To: Admissions Committee

I am pleased to recommend Asha Perera for postgraduate study. I taught Asha in Machine Learning and supervised her final year project.

Asha is an outstanding student and ranks in the top 10% of her cohort. She demonstrates excellent analytical thinking and strong engineering discipline.

Her ML project work was implemented with clean code, reproducible experiments, and strong documentation. She is proactive, collaborative, and capable of delivering production-quality work.

Sincerely,
Dr. N. Fernando
