RECOMMENDATION LETTER
To: Admissions Committee

Meera Iqbal has been one of the strongest students I have taught in Probability & Statistics. Her work quality is exceptional, and she approaches problems with maturity.

She consistently demonstrates strong reasoning, careful experimentation, and clear communication. I fully support her application.

Sincerely,
Dr. P. Raman
Associate Professor
