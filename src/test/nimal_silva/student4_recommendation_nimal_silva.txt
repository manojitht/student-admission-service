RECOMMENDATION LETTER
To: Admissions Committee

I strongly recommend Nimal Silva. Nimal is an outstanding candidate who ranks in the top 5% of students I have supervised in the last five years.

His work ethic is exceptional and his research capabilities are excellent. He delivered an outstanding deep learning capstone project with rigor and attention to detail.

Sincerely,
