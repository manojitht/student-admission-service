RECOMMENDATION LETTER
To: Admissions Committee

I recommend Sara Jayasinghe for postgraduate study. Sara shows strong practical engineering skills and a positive attitude.

Her capstone project was well executed, and she communicates clearly. She would be a good fit for advanced study.

Sincerely,
Mr. K. Perera
Senior Lecturer
Lakeside Institute
